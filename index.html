        <h2>13 Years Experience with Social Work and Break Dance</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                I was born and raised in Brazil, where movement and rhythm were a part of my everyday life. For 13 years, I dedicated myself to dance, specializing in Contemporary, Ballet, and <a href="https://youtu.be/D60rFNfhyv0?si=B6Tcd015CUwk59u5">Break Dance</a>. Dance was my passion and profession, allowing me to perform and connect with audiences through movement.

                In 2011, I met a dutch girl whom became my wife, And you know what they say love is blind and made change the warmth of Brazil for the mostly cold days of the Netherlands as we got married and I moved to the Netherlands in 2012. Embracing a new culture and way of life. Here I have followed a different path by studying International Communicatio and Media at The University of Applied Science HoogeSchool Utrecht, were I specialized in marketing.

            <p>
                I worked for about 2 years in the tourism sector, applying my skills in marketing and digital experiences. However, when the Covid-19 pandemic hit, I lost my tourism clients, forcing me to rethink my career path. Determined to adapt, I enrolled in a coding bootcamp (Le Wagon) and transitioned into frontend development role.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Today, I thrive as a frontend developer, utilizing my creative background to craft engaging digital experiences. My journey from dance to development has been unexpected, but each step has shaped who I amâ€”resilient, adaptable, and always ready to embrace new challenges.
